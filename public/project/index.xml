      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;synthesizing-the-north-american-fire-scar-network&#34;&gt;Synthesizing the North American Fire Scar Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2000 tree-ring fire history sites have been sampled over the last 40 years, and yet few have attempted to consolidate, organize, and understand this incredible resource. Ellis Margolis and I are leading a group of over 30 scientists to synthesize the record of historical fire regimes across the North American continent. The project is in its infancy, but already we&amp;rsquo;ve added more than 1000 sites to the data set of publicly available tree-ring fire history collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for collaborators and data contributors. If you would like to join us, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;developing-data-and-knowledge-toward-the-preservation-protection-and-forest-management-of-culturally-modified-trees-on-the-navajo-nation&#34;&gt;Developing data and knowledge toward the preservation, protection, and forest management of culturally modified trees on the Navajo Nation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, as I&amp;rsquo;ve tromped through the amazing Navajo forests I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered hundreds of culturally-modified trees (CMTs). Usually ponderosa pine, these trees have had a section of bark removed in order to gather the cambial layer (living tissue between the bark and the wood) and the inner bark. There are numerous uses of these materials - from medical to ritual to emergency food or supplemental livestock feed - and the passage of time leaves a beautiful wound on the the trunk. &amp;ldquo;Peel trees&amp;rdquo; are like windows into the past because they mark human activity on the landscape, and dendrochronologists like myself can non-invasively sample the peels and determine the year of peeling. That&amp;rsquo;s powerful information!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I approached the Navajo Heritage and Historic Preservation Department about the trees. My years of avoiding them, because I did not a cultural resources sampling permit or permission, were coming to an end. I was 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chguiterman.github.io/Nav_report/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;actively sampling old-growth forests&lt;/a&gt;
 where the lack of logging has left many of these trees still around. I offered to sample the wounds on the CMTs and report back with my findings. Soon thereafter I began to collaborate with William Tsosie, the Forest Archaeologist for HHPD. Now, Will and myself along with other colleagues are beginning to document and collect samples from every CMT tree that we can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 we received seed funds from the University of Arizona Foundation that we will use to sample a dense cluster of CMTs Will found near Wheatfields Lake along the Arizona-New Mexico border on the Navajo Nation. Hopefully the peoples of the Navajo Nation will emerge healthy from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we get out there and discover history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;integrated-watershed-hazard-assessment-for-wildfire-floods-and-debris-flows-in-the-navajo-nation&#34;&gt;Integrated watershed hazard assessment for wildfire, floods, and debris flows in the Navajo Nation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More frequent and extreme events in the southwestern United States, including wildfires and intense storms, raise concerns about forest and watershed health. High-severity crown fires are growing more extensive and the summer monsoon storms that can extinguish wildfires also create flood and debris-flow hazards. These events have lasting social and ecological impacts, and responding to them is challenging because of the rapid fire-to-flood transition time. Pre-wildfire planning is essential for mitigation of hazardous impacts to forested watersheds, and the homes, communities, and infrastructure within and far downstream of a burned area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Ann Youberg (Arizona Geological Survey/University of Arizona), I am conducting an integrated watershed hazard assessment to evaluate and map the probability and potential impacts of extreme fire-flood-debris-flow events in watersheds of the Navajo Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chguiterman.github.io/Navajo_Watersheds/map.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://chguiterman.github.io/Navajo_Watersheds/map.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project brings together resource managers from the Navajo Nation Division of Natural Resources, Division of Transportation, Department of Emergency Management, and BIA Wildland Fire Management. Managers are directing our attention to those watersheds that they perceive most at-risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk assessment will consist of computer simulations of fire, flooding, and debris flows that are calibrated and corroborated with local ground-based data. Simulations will be run for (1) current forest conditions pre-fire, (2) current forest conditions post-fire, and (3) treated forest conditions post-fire. Simulated forest health treatments will include thinning and prescribed burning for reduction of tree density and forest fuels, and will aid in targeting specific areas for greatest resource benefit by restoration activities in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from this study will be used in planning within the Navajo Nation Integrated Resource Management Plan (IRMP) and the Navajo Nation Climate Adaptation Plan, as well as on-the-ground efforts for greater resilience, including infrastructure improvements and pre-disaster hazard mitigation projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently funded by the BIA Tribal Resilience Program through 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-pyrodiversity-in-the-american-southwest&#34;&gt;Historical pyrodiversity in the American Southwest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project we are seeking to better understand - and highlight - the spatial and temporal diversity of historical fire regimes in Arizona and New Mexico as reconstructed from tree rings. Currently, we are examining 414 sites including 5,039 trees, and 37,220 fire scars (and the network is growing). We have found substantial diversity in fire activity, fire seasonality, and fire-climate relationships.

This project is a collaboration with Ellis Margolis, Steven Malevich, Tom Swetnam, Don Falk, Chris Baisan, Erica Bigio, Peter Fule, and Peter Brown.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;burnr&#34;&gt;burnr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been collaborating to develop the &lt;code&gt;burnr&lt;/code&gt; fire history library for more than 4 years. It&amp;rsquo;s as much enjoyment as it is self-serving &amp;ndash; I needed to do a lot of fire history analyses for my dissertation and I wanted to do that in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. As good as other fire history programs are, I am an unashamed addict of using &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. But more than that, I see the incredible potential of &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; for tree ring and all sciences, and I wanted to help others similarly interested in applying the program and its myriad of features to their own work. I truly hope people will use &lt;code&gt;burnr&lt;/code&gt;, and I am more than happy to help in that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have used &lt;code&gt;burnr&lt;/code&gt; in several research projects, including my work on 
&lt;a href=&#34;/chris-guiterman.rbind.io/chris-guiterman.rbind.io/publication/guiterman-18-shrubs/&#34;&gt;shrubfields&lt;/a&gt;
 and the 
&lt;a href=&#34;/chris-guiterman.rbind.io/chris-guiterman.rbind.io/publication/guiterman-19-navfire/&#34;&gt;Navajo fire history&lt;/a&gt;
. Several more papers are in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also pushing the bounds of &lt;code&gt;burnr&lt;/code&gt; by conducting large-scale syntheses for the 
&lt;a href=&#34;/chris-guiterman.rbind.io/chris-guiterman.rbind.io/project/sw-fire-synthesis/&#34;&gt;American Southwest&lt;/a&gt;
 and for the 
&lt;a href=&#34;/chris-guiterman.rbind.io/chris-guiterman.rbind.io/project/na-fire-synthesis/&#34;&gt;North American Continent&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have put together a teaching demo of &lt;code&gt;burnr&lt;/code&gt; that includes all of the data and code required to run through a bunch of basics, and some advanced features, using &lt;code&gt;burnr&lt;/code&gt;. Please check it out at
