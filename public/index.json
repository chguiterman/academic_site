The ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) log was discovered in 1924, and since then, it has been included in “birth” and “life” narratives of Pueblo Bonito, although these ideas have not been rigorously tested. We evaluate three potential growth origins of the tree (JPB-99): Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon, or a distant mountain range. Based on converging lines of evidence—documentary records, strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr), and tree-ring provenance testing—we present a new origin for the Plaza Tree. It did not grow in Pueblo Bonito or even nearby in Chaco Canyon. Rather, JPB-99 originated from the Chuska Mountains, over 50 km west of Chaco Canyon. The tree was likely carried to Pueblo Bonito sometime between AD 1100 and 1130, although why it was left in the west courtyard, what it meant, and how it might have been used remain mysteries. The origin of the Plaza Tree of Pueblo Bonito underscores deep cultural and material ties between the Chaco Canyon great houses and the Chuska landscape.","tags":"","title":"Convergence of Evidence Supports a Chuska Mountains Origin for the Plaza Tree of Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Synthesizing the North American Fire Scar Record Nearly 2000 tree-ring fire history sites have been sampled over the last 40 years, and yet few have attempted to consolodate, organize, and understand this incredible resource.

Usually ponderosa pine, these trees have had a section of bark removed in order to gather the cambial layer (living tissue between the bark and the wood) and the inner bark. There are numerous uses of these materials - from medical to ritual to emergency food or supplemental livestock feed - and the passage of time leaves a beautiful wound on the the trunk. \u0026ldquo;Peel trees\u0026rdquo; are like windows into the past because they mark human activity on the landscape, and dendrochronologists like myself can non-invasively sample the peels and determine the year of peeling.

My years of avoiding them, because I did not a cultural resources sampling permit or permission, were coming to an end. I was actively sampling old-growth forests\rwhere the lack of logging has left many of these trees still around. I offered to sample the wounds on the CMTs and report back with my findings. Soon thereafter I began to collaborate with William Tsosie, the Forest Archaeologist for HHPD.

High-severity crown fires are growing more extensive and the summer monsoon storms that can extinguish wildfires also create flood and debris-flow hazards. These events have lasting social and ecological impacts, and responding to them is challenging because of the rapid fire-to-flood transition time. Pre-wildfire planning is essential for mitigation of hazardous impacts to forested watersheds, and the homes, communities, and infrastructure within and far downstream of a burned area.\nAlong with Ann Youberg (Arizona Geological Survey/University of Arizona), I am conducting an integrated watershed hazard assessment to evaluate and map the probability and potential impacts of extreme fire-flood-debris-flow events in watersheds of the Navajo Nation.\n\rhttps://chguiterman.github.io/Navajo_Watersheds/map.html\rThis project brings together resource managers from the Navajo Nation Division of Natural Resources, Division of Transportation, Department of Emergency Management, and BIA Wildland Fire Management.

We developed a spatial human land-use model for Navajo Nation forests across which we sampled a network of tree-ring fire history sites to reflect contrasting historical land-use intensity: high human use, primarily in the Chuska Mountains, and low human use, primarily on the central Defiance Plateau. We tested for and compared human- and climate-driven changes in the fire regimes by applying change point detection, regression, and superposed epoch analyses. The historical fire regimes and fire–climate relationships reflect those of similar forests regionally and are similar between the two Navajo landscapes until the early 1800s.We then determined that a previously identified, localized, early (1830s) decline in fire activity was geographically widespread across higher human-use sites. In contrast, fires continued to burn uninterrupted through this period at the lower use sites. Though the 1830s included significantly wet and cold periods that could have contributed to fire regime decline, human factors pose a more spatiotemporally consistent explanation. A rise in Navajo pastoralism in the 1820s–1830s was concentrated seasonally in the heavy use sites. By the 1880s, livestock numbers more than doubled, grazing became far more spatially widespread, and frequent fire regimes of Navajo forests collapsed. The last widespread fire recorded on either landscape was in 1886. In the Chuska Mountains, livestock and fire coexisted for over 50 yr between the initial 1832 fire decline and the end of frequent fires after 1886, an exceptional pattern in the western United States. Though unique in its timing, character, and spatial dynamics, the collapse of historical fire regimes in Navajo forests contributed to now over a century without frequent surface fire, leaving Navajo forests at risk for large, uncharacteristic high-severity fires.","tags":null,"title":"Spatiotemporal variability in human-fire interactions on the Navajo Nation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Historical pyrodiversity in the American Southwest In this project we are seeking to better understand - and highlight - the spatial and temporal diversity of historical fire regimes in Arizona and New Mexico as reconstructed from tree rings.

However, most trees and sample sites represented in the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) were chosen to maximize climate signal and are characterized by marginal growing conditions not representative of the larger forest ecosystem. We evaluate the magnitude of this potential bias using a spatially unbiased tree-ring network collected by the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. We show that U.S. Southwest ITRDB samples overestimate regional forest climate sensitivity by 41–59%, because ITRDB trees were sampled at warmer and drier locations, both at the macro- and micro-site scale, and are systematically older compared to the FIA collection. Although there are uncertainties associated with our statistical approach, projection based on representative FIA samples suggests 29% less of a climate change-induced growth decrease compared to projection based on climate-sensitive ITRDB samples.","tags":"","title":"Sampling bias overestimates climate change impacts on forest growth in the southwestern United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Guiterman","Ellis Margolis"],"categories":null,"content":"Largely based on my dissertation work, this report summarizes mutliple projects conducted in collaboration with the Navajo Forestry Department t address concerns they voiced regarding the potential effects of climate change on their forest resources.\nFind the report at https://chguiterman.github.io/Nav_report/\r","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"f2edd7aef5eb50672b2ded0e5ba53264","permalink":"/publication/guiterman-18-navvulnverabilities/","publishdate":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guiterman-18-navvulnverabilities/","section":"publication","summary":"Historical and projected perspectives reveal areas of high risk and opportunities across 700,000 acres of Navajo forests.","tags":"","title":"Vulnerabilities of Navajo Nation Forests to Climate Change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Guiterman","Ellis Margolis","Craig Allen","Don Falk","Tom Swetnam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587598655,"objectID":"13415e661f700035356b4ae3edaeecd4","permalink":"/publication/guiterman-18-shrubs/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guiterman-18-shrubs/","section":"publication","summary":"Extensive high-severity fires are creating large shrubfields in many dry conifer forests of the interior western USA, raising concerns about forest- to-shrub conversion. This study evaluates the role of disturbance in shrubfield formation, maintenance and succession in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico. We compared the environmental conditions of extant Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) shrubfields with adjoining dry conifer forests and used dendroecological methods to determine the multi-century fire history and successional dynamics of five of the largest shrubfields (76– 340 ha). Across the study area, 349 shrubfields (5– 368 ha) occur in similar topographic and climate settings as dry conifer forests. This suggests disturbance, rather than other biophysical factors, may explain their origins and persistence. Gambel oak ages and tree-ring fire scars in our sampled shrubfields indicate they historically (1664–1899) burned concurrently with adjoining conifer forests and have persisted for over 115 years in the absence of fire. Aerial imagery from 1935 confirmed almost no change in sampled shrubfield patch sizes or boundaries over the twentieth century. The largest shrubfield we identified is less than 4% the size of the largest conifer-depleted and substantially shrub-dominated area recently formed in the Jemez following extensive high-severity wildfires, indicating considerable departure from historical patterns and processes. Projected hotter droughts and increasingly large high-severity fires could trigger more forest-to-shrub transitions and maintain existing shrubfields, inhibiting conifer forest recovery. Restoration of surface fire regimes and associated historical forest structures likely could reduce the rate and patch size of dry conifer forests being converted to shrubfields.","tags":"","title":"Long-Term Persistence and Fire Resilience of Oak Shrubfields in Dry Conifer Forests of Northern New Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Margaret Evans","Paul Gugger","Ann Lynch","Chris Guiterman","Joshua Fowler","Stefan Klesse","Erin Riordan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587088673,"objectID":"3a57b90b98aae589ff634ee9f4c171fe","permalink":"/publication/evans-18-comment/","publishdate":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/evans-18-comment/","section":"publication","summary":"Commentary on [Housset et al., New Phytologist 218: 630–645.](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.14968)","tags":"","title":"Dendroecology meets genomics in the common garden: new insights into climate adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steven Malevich","Chris Guiterman","Ellis Margolis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587088673,"objectID":"38c2db3d17db00ca02a166cd16bc9ff5","permalink":"/publication/malevich-18-burnr/","publishdate":"2018-03-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/malevich-18-burnr/","section":"publication","summary":"We developed a new software package, burnr, for fire history analysis and plotting in the R statistical programming environment.

We evaluate probable timber procurement areas for seven great houses by applying tree-ring width-based sourcing to a set of 170 timbers. To our knowledge, this is the first use of tree rings to assess timber origins in the southwestern United States. We found that the Chuska and Zuni Mountains (75 km distant) were the most likely sources, accounting for 70% of timbers. Most notably, procurement areas changed through time. Before 1020 Common Era (CE) nearly all timbers originated from the Zunis (a previously unrecognized source), but by 1060 CE the Chuskas eclipsed the Zuni area in total wood imports. This shift occurred at the onset of Chaco florescence in the 11th century, a time with substantial expansion of existing great houses and the addition of seven new great houses in the Chaco Core area. It also coincides with the proliferation of Chuskan stone tools and pottery in the archaeological record of Chaco Canyon, further underscoring the link between land use and occupation in the Chuska area and the peak of great house construction. Our findings, based on the most temporally specific and replicated evidence of Chacoan resource procurement obtained to date, corroborate the long-standing but recently challenged interpretation that large numbers of timbers were harvested and transported from distant mountain ranges to build the great houses at Chaco Canyon.","tags":"","title":"Eleventh-century shift in timber procurement areas for the great houses of Chaco Canyon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Guiterman","Ellis Margolis","Tom Swetnam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587088673,"objectID":"55a657cbd83088f653aabb8fdda4e537","permalink":"/publication/guiterman-15-pgm/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guiterman-15-pgm/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent high-severity fires in pine-oak forests of the southwestern United States are creating shrubfields that may persist for decades to centuries. Shrubfields embedded in conifer forests that pre- date documentary records are potential evidence of older high-severity fire patches, and may therefore provide insights into the occurrence and extent of past high-severity fires and vegetation type conversion dynamics. In this paper we test whether dendroecological evidence can be used to reconstruct a high-severity, type-changing fire of known date in a ponderosa pine-dominated (Pinus ponderosa var scopulorum Engelm.) forest. Dendroecological evidence included (1) Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii, Nutt.) regeneration dates, (2) fire scars, (3) death dates, and (4) tree-ring growth changes. We reconstructed the historical fire regime and fire-climate relationship to evaluate whether the recent high-severity fire was driven by climate or fuel build-up related to a fire regime disruption. The dendroecological evidence correctly dated the year (1993) and season (spring) of the documented fire, and synchronous oak re-sprouts provided a means to estimate the minimum high-severity patch size. The historical fire regime at the site (1625–1871) consisted of frequent, low-severity fires occurring in dry years preceded by wet years. Fires stopped in 1871, coincident with increased regional livestock grazing. The 1993 fire occurred under relatively cool and wet conditions, but followed a 122-year fire- free interval (four times the maximum historical interval). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that increased fuel loads from fire exclusion, combined with high winds, were primary drivers of the high- severity fire. The dendroecological approach we outline can be applied to reconstruct high-severity fire across a range of conifer-shrubland ecosystems.","tags":"","title":"Dendroecological methods for reconstructing high severity fire in pine-oak forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pearce Paul Creasman","Chris Baisan","Chris Guiterman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587347853,"objectID":"15675efe4b3b01facd22ec265428464c","permalink":"/publication/creaseman-15-charlestown/","publishdate":"2015-03-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/creaseman-15-charlestown/","section":"publication","summary":"More than 200 ships were built, and thousands serviced, at Charlestown Navy Yard (Boston, MA) in its 174 years of service for the U.S. Navy (1800–1974 C.E.). Recent redevelopment of portions of the former yard revealed an historic timber pond where hundreds of unfinished naval-quality ship timbers were intentionally sunk and remained buried until ca. 2008. Many of these timbers were offered to the Henry B. du Pont Preservation Shipyard (Mystic Seaport, CT) for their restoration of Charles W. Morgan. Courtesy of Mystic Seaport, 38 specimens from the Charlestown yard (mostly Quercus sp.; including live [evergreen] oak and white oak) were selected for dendrochronological analysis. Most of the white oak specimens could be sourced with confidence to Ohio. Dates clustered in the late 1860s, suggesting late-Civil War or Reconstruction Era activities. This paper discusses the dates, origin, and other findings derived from this collection.","tags":"","title":"Dendrochronological evaluation of ship timber from Charlestown Navy Yard (Boston, MA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca Brice","Kara Lorion","Daniel Griffin","Alison Macalady","**Chris Guiterman**","James Speer","Laura Benakoun","Amy Cutter","Megan Hart","Michael Murray","Steve Nash","Rob Shepard","Ashley Stewart","Haitao Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587598655,"objectID":"c88096beb8dfcd9e64d87f1cb41095be","permalink":"/publication/brice-2013-latewood/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brice-2013-latewood/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Signal strength in sub-annual chronologies from Pinus ponderosa in northern New Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Guiterman","Robert Seymour","Aaron Weiskittel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1328054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587598655,"objectID":"6000bbb6449eeaca745052d9cccdf497","permalink":"/publication/guiterman-12-lai/","publishdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guiterman-12-lai/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Long-Term Thinning Effects on the Leaf Area of Pinus strobus L. as Estimated from Litterfall and Individual-Tree Allometric Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Guiterman","Aaron Weiskittel","Robert Seymour"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1314835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587598655,"objectID":"ee1c7153a44b66df8bafb162897422ef","permalink":"/publication/guiterman-11-gfc/","publishdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guiterman-11-gfc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Influences of Conventional and Low-Density Thinning on the Lower Bole Taper and Volume Growth of Eastern White Pine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586911636,"objectID":"5c9d1d630c08cf58355a8f4e841eaf8c","permalink":"/project/dfoliatr/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dfoliatr/","section":"project","summary":"An R package for analyzing insect defoliation signals in tree rings.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"project"}]
