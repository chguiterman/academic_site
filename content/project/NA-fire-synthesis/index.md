## Synthesizing the North American Fire Scar Network
More than 2,100 tree-ring fire history sites have been sampled over the last 40 years, and yet few researchers have attempted to consolidate, organize, and understand this incredible resource. Ellis Margolis and I are leading a group of over 60 scientists to synthesize the record of historical fire regimes across the North American continent. The project is in its infancy, but our group of motivated collaborators have already added more than 1,000 sites to the data set of publicly available tree-ring fire history collections.
