## Synthesizing the North American Fire Scar Record
Nearly 2000 tree-ring fire history sites have been sampled over the last 40 years, and yet few have attempted to consolidate, organize, and understand this incredible resource. Ellis Margolis and I are leading a group of over 30 scientists to synthesize the record of historical fire regimes across the North American continent. The project is in its infancy, but already we've added more than 1000 sites to the data set of publicly available tree-ring fire history collections.
