In this project we are seeking to better understand - and highlight - the spatial and temporal diversity of historical fire regimes in Arizona and New Mexico as reconstructed from tree rings. Currently, we are examining 414 sites including 5,039 trees, and 37,220 fire scars (and the network is growing). We have found substantial diversity in fire activity, fire seasonality, and fire-climate relationships.
