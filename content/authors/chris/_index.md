I am a Research Scientist at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. My research interests cover a range of topics including forest disturbance ecology, forest demography, human-environmental interactions, and archaeology. I am keen to understand how humans and climate change have affected forest resilience and how these lessons can be applied to management decisions. I am also active in developing new tools and resources for tree-ring scientists to improve field sampling, analytical methods, and data visualization. 

I currently work remotely for the Tree-Ring Lab from my home in Hanover, New Hampshire.
