abstract: 'Snowpack in the western U.S. is on the decline, largely attributed to increasing temperatures in the region. This is
a critical issue for many Native American communities who disproportionately rely on local snow-fed water
supplies. In light of a combined ongoing drought and limited climate information for the Navajo Nation, Navajo
water managers face decision-making challenges complicated by past and future climate uncertainty. Developed
in partnership with the Navajo Nation Water Management Branch, this study documents two snowpack reconstruction
options to address Navajo concerns about the amount and variability of snowpack in the Chuska
Mountains. We used two separate snowpack datasets with tree rings collected in northern Arizona to develop and
evaluate reconstructions of Chuska snowpack and their potential relevance and usefulness to Navajo water
managers’ decision-making. We found that both reconstructions skillfully estimated snowpack, though there
were differences that may have meaningful implications for water managers. Major snow droughts occurred
roughly once per century over the last 300 years, with droughts in 1728–1744, 1818–1834, 1950–1977, and
1999–2006. Extremely dry individual years in each reconstruction punctuate multi-year drought periods in a
way that has not been recognized from instrumental data alone and that can have a large influence on the overall
intensity of a given drought. The reconstruction that is most representative of Chuska snowpack has less
explanatory power than the regionally representative reconstruction, but the Chuska reconstruction effectively
captures snowpack extremes and snow drought timing unique to the Chuska Mountains, and may hold greater
relevance to Navajo water management.'
