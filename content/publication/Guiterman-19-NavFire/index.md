title: Historical human-fire interactions on the Navajo Nation
Abstract: "Unraveling the effects of climate and land use on historical fire regimes provides important
insights into broader human–fire–climate dynamics, which are necessary for ecologically based forest management.
We developed a spatial human land-use model for Navajo Nation forests across which we sampled
a network of tree-ring fire history sites to reflect contrasting historical land-use intensity: high human
use, primarily in the Chuska Mountains, and low human use, primarily on the central Defiance Plateau.
We tested for and compared human- and climate-driven changes in the fire regimes by applying change
point detection, regression, and superposed epoch analyses. The historical fire regimes and fire–climate
relationships reflect those of similar forests regionally and are similar between the two Navajo landscapes
until the early 1800s.We then determined that a previously identified, localized, early (1830s) decline in fire
activity was geographically widespread across higher human-use sites. In contrast, fires continued to burn
uninterrupted through this period at the lower use sites. Though the 1830s included significantly wet and
cold periods that could have contributed to fire regime decline, human factors pose a more spatiotemporally
consistent explanation. A rise in Navajo pastoralism in the 1820s–1830s was concentrated seasonally
in the heavy use sites. By the 1880s, livestock numbers more than doubled, grazing became far more spatially
widespread, and frequent fire regimes of Navajo forests collapsed. The last widespread fire recorded
on either landscape was in 1886. In the Chuska Mountains, livestock and fire coexisted for over 50 yr
between the initial 1832 fire decline and the end of frequent fires after 1886, an exceptional pattern in the
western United States. Though unique in its timing, character, and spatial dynamics, the collapse of historical
fire regimes in Navajo forests contributed to now over a century without frequent surface fire, leaving
Navajo forests at risk for large, uncharacteristic high-severity fires."
